Read the attached paper. I am also attaching the GUIDE model for the "all" dataset with L=100 latent factors. Specifically, I'm attaching:
- the GUIDE X -> L (SNP to latent) and L ->T (latent to trait) variance components matrices with the top 100 values per latent (phenotype_var_comp_top100_per_latent.csv, variant_var_comp_top100_per_latent.csv)
- the GUIDE X -> L (SNP to latent) and L ->T (latent to trait) contribution scores matrices with the top 100 values per latent (variant_contribution_top100_per_latent.csv, phenotype_contribution_top100_per_latent.csv)
- the GUIDE X -> L (SNP to latent) and L ->T (latent to trait) -log10(w-values) matrices computed using the variance components with the top 100 values per latent (variant_logw_mat_XL_top100_per_latent.csv, phenotype_logw_mat_LT_top100_per_latent.csv)
- the trait labels (phenotype_labels.txt)
- the genetic variant (SNP) labels (variant_labels.txt)
- dictionary from SNP to nearest gene(snp_gene_annotation.json)
Using this information, for every one of the 100 latent factors write a short, informative label that encapsulates and best characterizes its biological/mechanistic/pathophysiological role. Also, provide a written summary describing its most likely role given its most significant variance components, contribution scores, and w-values relative to both traits and genetic variants. (The contribution scores, unlike the variance components, does not include the scaling information, and should be understood as representing the degree to which a given genetic variant or trait maps onto a given latent factor based on the optimal basis found by GUIDE, as opposed to the specific linear combination, using the scaling information, that is particular to the given dataset.)
Write this as an expert, world-class geneticist. The tone should be professional, the language precise and clear, and the analysis thorough and rigorous, with references to standard databases and peer-reviewed research articles. All claims should be supported by the information attached and/or by the references described in the previous sentence.
